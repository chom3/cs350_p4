Like the previous project, this program will do matrix multiplication.
Each process will handle one multiply in each part of the matrix.
Input must have at least 3 ***'s.
i.e.
1 2 3
4 5 6
***
1 2
3 4
5 6

The output will be to a file of your choosing and to the console.
To compile: g++ HomCoreyP4.cpp
To use:
./a.out input output

Not much was done differently from the past project. I basically cut out the thread part and added the
process part.
